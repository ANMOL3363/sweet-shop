AI USAGE
- I used AI (CHATGPT) as a productivity and learning tool — mainly to understand architecture patterns, debug errors faster, and generate boilerplate.
I always verified and modified the logic by myself, and all integration decisions were mine.

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd backend
